Anah – Arabic Emotion-Aware Journaling Web App

A personal mental-wellbeing journal that understands your emotions.

Anah (أناه) is a full-stack web application designed to help users express, track, and analyze their emotions through a daily journaling experience.
The system combines traditional NLP (lexicon-based analysis) with a fine-tuned Arabic transformer model (MARBERTv2){future work} to detect emotional patterns from user-written text.

Calm, Happy, Sad, Angry, Stressed, Tired
